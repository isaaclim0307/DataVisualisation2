    <center><h1>Population Growth</h1>
    <h3>Introduction</h3></center>
    <p>Population Growth refers to the annual average rate of change of population size for a given country during a specific period.
        Population Growth can be determined by the birth rate and the death rate of a certain country. If the death rate is higher than 
        the birth rate, population size of that country will be smaller in that year. The first idiom is a map which shows the total population
        for each country. The second idiom is a bubble plot which display the birth rate and death rate for each country. The third idiom is a 
        line chart which compares the death rate of Australia and Malaysia from year 2000 to 2021. The last idiom is a stacked bar chart which 
        shows the total number of deaths for male and female categorized by age group in year 2020.

    <center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>
    <p>As a conclusion, the total population of each country in the world is unbalance as some countries such as United States of America
        and China have a large population while countries like Greenland only has a small population. This has caused issues such as 
        unbalanced distribution of food or medical equipment to each country during difficult times such as Covid-19 pandemic.
